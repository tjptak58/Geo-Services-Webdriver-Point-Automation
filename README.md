# Geo-Services-Webdriver-Point-Automation

In 2020, Geo Services Inc tasked me with organizing their drilling data into a web interface. To complete the project I used ArcGis, a web based,
interactive map. Started by taking their pdf drilling reports and uploading them to a cloud service (SYNC). Then in ArcGis, I plotted points (lat/long)
at each hole where the company driled. Then I would attach the link to the boring's drilling report.

It became clear early on that this was way to slow to do by hand so I wrote a python script using selenium webdriver to speed up the process
